# Gunn TUWA

Gunn TUWA (Titan's Unofficial Web App) is the one utility you'll ever need for everything Gunn. It is currently a work in progress and more features will be comming soon.

## Why TUWA

Many of TUWA's predicesors are lacking in some aspects and are just not useful to an everyday student. TUWA plans to solve these issues rapidly using feedback and code from students rather than the slow process of feature requests. We welcome all people and ideas to help make TUWA a better app.

## Feature Progress

## Technical Details

The TUWA web client (this repo) is made using SolidJS. We plan on adding a backend soon but that will come later down the line.

## Development

To develop for TUWA web client you will need basic understanding of TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript), Understanding of JSX, [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Installing Dependencies:
```sh
pnpm install
