# Gunn TUWA

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/11619b07-8788-4d13-bde3-45de33fbc093/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tuwa/deploys)

Gunn TUWA (Titan's Unofficial Web App) is the one utility you'll ever need for everything Gunn. It
is currently a work in progress and more features will be comming soon.

## Why TUWA

Many of TUWA's predicesors are lacking in some aspects and are just not useful to an everyday
student. TUWA plans to solve these issues rapidly using feedback and code from students rather than
the slow process of feature requests. We welcome all people and ideas to help make TUWA a better
app. View TUWA at [tuwa.netlify.app](https://tuwa.netlify.app).

## Want to help?

There are many ways to contribute to the development of TUWA. You can help by reporting bugs, requesting features, translating via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gunn-tuwa). or even contributing code. Feel free to do any of these things!

## Technical Details

The TUWA web client (this repo) is made using SolidJS. We plan on adding a backend soon but that
will come later down the line.

## Development

To develop for TUWA web client you will need basic understanding of TypeScript (a superset of
JavaScript), Understanding of JSX, [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Installing Dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Running the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

After this the server should be accessible at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
